# Docker HTTP Vagrant Example

This example demonstrates using Vagrant with the Docker provider to run an nginx container.

## Prerequisites

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running
- Vagrant Docker plugin installed:
  ```bash
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
  ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd vagrant/examples/docker-http
   ```

2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

3. Access nginx (running on container port 80, forwarded to host port 8080):
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```
   Or open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

4. Check container status:
   ```bash
   vagrant status
   ```

5. Stop the container:
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```

6. Destroy the container:
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```

## What this example does

- Uses the official `nginx:alpine` Docker image
- Creates a container named `vagrant-nginx-container`
- Forwards port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container
- Keeps the container running in the background
- No virtual machine overhead - runs directly on Docker
