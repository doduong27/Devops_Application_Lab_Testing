// Lab 5: Conditional Deployment
//
// Instructions:
// Create a pipeline that:
//   1. Has a "Build" stage that always runs
//   2. Has a "Deploy to Production" stage that only runs when branch is "main"
//   3. Use the 'when' directive with 'branch' condition
//
// TODO: Complete the pipeline below

pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building application...'
            }
        }
        
        // TODO: Add "Deploy to Production" stage that only runs on main branch
    }
}
