# Lab 6: Complete Project - Mission Control System
# 
# Instructions:
# Create a complete mission control system that:
# 1. Accepts mission name and crew size as command line arguments
# 2. Creates a mission log file with mission information
# 3. Validates that crew size is between 1 and 10
# 4. Performs system checks and logs them
# 5. Calculates fuel requirements based on crew size
# 6. Writes all information to a mission log file
#
# Use functions to organize your code
# Handle errors appropriately
#
# Example Usage:
#   python3 lab-06-complete-project.py mars-mission 5
#
# Example Output:
# === Mission Control System ===
# Mission: mars-mission
# Crew size: 5
# Fuel required: 5000 liters
# Systems: All operational
# Mission log created: mission_log.txt
