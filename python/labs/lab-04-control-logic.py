# Lab 4: Control Logic
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. Create a fuel level check function:
#    - If fuel > 80: print "Excellent"
#    - Else if fuel > 60: print "Good"
#    - Else if fuel > 40: print "Moderate"
#    - Else: print "Warning: Low fuel!"
#
# 2. Create a countdown from 10 to 1 using a for loop
#
# 3. Create a crew list and iterate through it, printing each member's name
#
# 4. Use a while loop to simulate system checks until all systems are ready
#
# Example Output:
# === Lab 4: Control Logic ===
# Fuel level: Excellent
# Countdown: 10... 9... 8... ... 1... Launch!
# Crew members:
#   - Alice
#   - Bob
#   - Charlie
# ...

print("=== Lab 4: Control Logic ===")

fuel_level = 85  # You can change this to test different levels
