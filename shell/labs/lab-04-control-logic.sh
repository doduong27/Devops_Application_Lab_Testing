# Lab 4: Control Logic
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Create a script that accepts a number as argument
# 2. Use if/else to check if the number is:
#    - Positive (> 0)
#    - Negative (< 0)
#    - Zero (= 0)
# 3. Use a for loop to count from 1 to that number
# 4. Use a while loop to display "Countdown: X" from the number down to 1
#
# Example Output:
# 
# $ ./lab-04-control-logic.sh 5
# === Lab 4: Control Logic ===
# The number is positive
# Counting from 1 to 5:
#   1
#   2
#   3
#   4
#   5
# Countdown from 5:
#   Countdown: 5
#   Countdown: 4
#   Countdown: 3
#   Countdown: 2
#   Countdown: 1
# Lab 4 completed!
#
# $ ./lab-04-control-logic.sh -3
# === Lab 4: Control Logic ===
# The number is negative
# Counting from 1 to -3:
# (no output for negative numbers)
# Countdown from -3:
# (no countdown for negative numbers)
# Lab 4 completed!
#
# $ ./lab-04-control-logic.sh 0
# === Lab 4: Control Logic ===
# The number is zero
# Counting from 1 to 0:
# (no output)
# Countdown from 0:
# (no countdown)
# Lab 4 completed!
